# Literature-Based ORC Optimization Approach

## Overview

Based on your requirements from the 2015-2016 literature, I've developed an enhanced optimization approach that properly implements the scientific criteria for working fluid selection and thermodynamic modeling.

## Key Literature Requirements Implemented

### 1. Working Fluid Selection Criteria

#### From 2015 Paper: "Optimal molecular design of working fluids for sustainable low-temperature energy recovery"

**Objective Function Should:**
- ✅ **Maximize enthalpy of vaporization (Hvap)**
- ✅ **Maximize the ratio of enthalpy of vaporization to heat capacity (Hvap/Cp)**
- ✅ **Minimize specific heat capacity (Cp)**

**Additional Criteria:**
- ✅ **High critical temperature (Tc)** - Better heat recovery potential
- ✅ **Low critical pressure (Pc)** - Safer operation, lower equipment costs
- ✅ **Optimal temperature difference: 35-50°C** between source and critical temperature
- ✅ **Environmental consideration: Low GWP preferred**

#### From 2016 Paper: Critical Pressure Constraint

**Safety Constraint:**
- ✅ **pe ≤ 0.9 × pc** - Avoid critical conditions of working fluid

### 2. Fluid Selection Analysis Results

Based on the literature criteria, the fluid ranking is:

| Rank | Fluid | Score | Tc (K) | Pc (bar) | ΔT (K) | Hvap/Cp | GWP | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|----------|--------|---------|-----|---------|
| 1 | **R600a** | 0.576 | 407.8 | 36.5 | -35.3 | 170.0 | 3 | ✅ **OPTIMAL** |
| 2 | **n-Butane** | 0.566 | 425.1 | 38.0 | -18.0 | 157.1 | 4 | ✅ **EXCELLENT** |
| 3 | **n-Pentane** | 0.561 | 469.7 | 33.7 | 26.6 | 130.0 | 4 | ✅ **VERY GOOD** |
| 4 | **Cyclopentane** | 0.544 | 511.7 | 45.1 | 68.5 | 134.1 | 5 | ✅ **GOOD** |
| 5 | **R245fa** | 0.538 | 427.2 | 36.5 | -16.0 | 145.2 | 1030 | ⚠️ **HIGH GWP** |

### 3. Key Findings

#### Temperature Difference Analysis
- **None of the fluids meet the ideal 35-50°C range** for this specific source temperature (170°C)
- **n-Pentane comes closest** with ΔT = 26.6°C
- **R600a and n-Butane** have negative temperature differences but excellent other properties

#### Environmental Impact
- **R600a, n-Butane, n-Pentane, and Cyclopentane** are environmentally excellent (GWP < 10)
- **R245fa** has high GWP (1030) and should be avoided for environmental reasons

#### Performance Characteristics
- **R600a** has the highest Hvap/Cp ratio (170.0) - excellent for power generation
- **n-Butane** has the highest enthalpy of vaporization (385.0 kJ/kg)
- **n-Pentane** has the lowest critical pressure (33.7 bar) - safest operation

## Enhanced GAMS Model Features

### 1. Literature-Compliant Fluid Database
```gams
Table fluid_props(i,*)
                Tc      Pc      omega   Mw      Hvap    cp_avg  GWP     Score
    R600a      407.81  36.48   0.1835  58.12   365.6   2.15    3       0.576
    n_Butane   425.12  37.96   0.2002  58.12   385.0   2.45    4       0.566
    n_Pentane  469.70  33.70   0.2515  72.15   357.6   2.75    4       0.561
    Cyclopentane 511.69 45.15  0.1956  70.13   389.0   2.90    5       0.544

```

### 2. Literature-Based Selection Criteria
```gams
* Temperature difference from critical temperature
temp_diff_criterion.. DT_critical =e= sum(i, y(i) * fluid_props(i,'Tc')) - T_hw_in;

* Maximize enthalpy of vaporization to heat capacity ratio (2015 paper)
hvap_cp_criterion.. Hvap_cp_ratio =e= sum(i, y(i) * fluid_props(i,'Hvap')) / 
                                     sum(i, y(i) * fluid_props(i,'cp_avg'));

* Critical pressure constraint: pe <= 0.9 * pc (2016 paper)
critical_pressure_limit.. P('1') =l= 0.9 * sum(i, y(i) * fluid_props(i,'Pc'));
```

### 3. Enhanced Thermodynamic Modeling

#### Peng-Robinson-Kamath Approach
- Enhanced enthalpy calculations based on fluid properties
- Proper consideration of vapor-liquid equilibrium
- Temperature-dependent property calculations

#### Exergy Analysis
```gams
* Exergy analysis (based on literature)
exergy_input.. Ex_in =e= Q_evap * (1 - T_ambient/T_hw_in);
exergy_output.. Ex_out =e= W_net;
exergy_destruction.. Ex_dest =e= Ex_in - Ex_out;
```

### 4. First Law Efficiency Implementation
```gams
* Thermal efficiency (First Law)
thermal_eff.. eta_thermal =e= W_net / Q_evap;

* Exergy efficiency (Second Law)
exergy_eff.. eta_exergy =e= Ex_out / Ex_in;
```
