     “Heat Recovery Process Optimization” Competition
Introduction
Heat recovery is of paramount importance in various industries and sectors due to its numerous
benefits. The process of capturing and utilizing waste heat not only minimizes energy wastage but
also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, thereby offering an environmentally friendly solution. By
implementing heat recovery systems, organizations can significantly enhance their energy
efficiency and lower operational costs. The recovered heat can be redirected to power generation,
heating applications, or even utilized for process requirements, thereby reducing the reliance on
conventional energy sources. Moreover, heat recovery promotes sustainability and resource
conservation, contributing to a greener and more sustainable future.
Several heat recovery methods can be employed to capture and utilize waste heat effectively.
Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is a heat recovery solution that utilizes organic fluids to convert
waste heat into usable energy. It is particularly effective in situations where the waste heat source
has a low or medium temperature range.
The ORC process (Figure 1) involves a closed-loop system where an organic fluid, with a lower
boiling point than water, is used as the working fluid. The waste heat is transferred to the organic
fluid in a heat exchanger, causing it to vaporize and expand. The expanding vapor drives a turbine,
which is connected to a generator, producing electricity. After passing through the turbine, the
vapor is condensed back into liquid form using a cooling system, and then it is pumped back into
the heat exchanger to repeat the cycle.

In order to improve the process efficiency, several ORC configurations have been proposed such
as the configuration shown in Figure 2).

Problem Statement
Consider a hot water stream with the specifications shown in Table 1.
                                Table 1: waste hot water stream specifications




In this study, you are asked to optimize the ORC unit (Configuration A) to maximize the power output of
the cycle. Assume that an air-cooled condenser is employed in the ORC unit. The input parameters and
calculation conditions are listed in Table 2.
                                     Table 2: Process design parameters




Competition assignments
The class students are asked to be separated into five groups (Table 3).
Each group must simulate and optimize Configuration A using an equation-oriented approach in
GAMS. Pure working fluid must be used in the cycles.




                                                      2
                                       Table 3: Working groups




Each group should incorporate the working fluid selection into the optimization problem. In other
words, there is no limitation on the working fluid and the optimal working fluid must be selected
in the process optimization problem. At least five working fluids must be considered in the basis
set from which the optimal one is selected by the optimizer.
Each group may gain 30% more score by simulating and optimizing Configuration B likewise.
The process optimization model must be correct in terms of both process design concepts and
formulation. The convergence time will be also considered as the measurement of the successful
formulation.
The group with the process which yields the highest power output wins the competition (20% more
score)
