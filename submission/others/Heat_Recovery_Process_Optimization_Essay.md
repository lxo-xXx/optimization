Two configurations were investigated: a simple ORC unit (Configuration A) and an enhanced ORC with recuperator (Configuration B). The optimization problem incorporates working fluid selection among five candidates (R134a, R245fa, R600a, R290, R1234yf) using mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulated in GAMS.

The methodology provides a robust framework for industrial heat recovery applications.

## Introduction

Heat recovery systems have emerged as critical technologies for enhancing energy efficiency and reducing environmental impact across various industrial sectors. The increasing focus on sustainable energy utilization and greenhouse gas emission reduction has driven significant research interest in waste heat recovery technologies. Among these, Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) have gained prominence due to their ability to convert low to medium-grade waste heat into useful electrical power.

The fundamental principle of ORC systems lies in their utilization of organic working fluids with lower boiling points compared to water, enabling efficient operation at relatively low temperatures. This characteristic makes ORC technology particularly suitable for waste heat recovery applications where conventional steam cycles would be inefficient or impractical. The selection of appropriate working fluids and system configurations plays a crucial role in determining the overall performance and economic viability of ORC systems.

Working fluid selection represents one of the most critical design decisions in ORC systems. The thermodynamic properties of the working fluid directly influence cycle efficiency, power output, and system complexity. Factors such as critical temperature, critical pressure, molecular weight, and environmental impact must be carefully considered. Refrigerants like R134a and R245fa have been widely studied, while natural refrigerants such as R290 (propane) and R600a (isobutane) offer environmental advantages. The newer generation refrigerant R1234yf provides low global warming potential while maintaining good thermodynamic performance.

System configuration optimization represents another avenue for performance enhancement. Simple ORC configurations provide baseline performance with minimal complexity, while advanced configurations incorporating recuperators, regenerators, or multiple pressure levels can achieve higher efficiencies at the cost of increased system complexity and capital investment. The recuperative ORC configuration, where waste heat from the turbine exhaust is used to preheat the working fluid before entering the evaporator, typically demonstrates improved thermal efficiency compared to simple configurations.

Mathematical optimization techniques have become indispensable tools for ORC system design and operation. Mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) approaches enable simultaneous optimization of continuous variables (temperatures, pressures, mass flow rates) and discrete decisions (working fluid selection, equipment sizing). The integration of rigorous thermodynamic property models, such as equations of state, ensures accurate representation of fluid behavior across the operating range.

The Peng-Robinson equation of state has proven particularly effective for modeling organic working fluids in ORC applications. Its ability to accurately predict vapor-liquid equilibrium and thermodynamic properties across a wide range of conditions makes it suitable for optimization studies. The Kamath algorithm provides efficient numerical methods for phase calculations and property estimation, essential for convergence in optimization problems.

Process integration considerations also play a vital role in ORC system optimization. The pinch point analysis helps identify optimal heat integration opportunities and establishes minimum temperature differences in heat exchangers. The approach temperature in condensers and pinch point temperature differences in evaporators represent critical design constraints that directly impact system performance and equipment sizing.

This study addresses the optimization of ORC systems for waste heat recovery applications through a comprehensive mathematical framework that simultaneously considers working fluid selection and system configuration. The research contributes to the existing literature by providing detailed MINLP formulations for both simple and recuperative ORC configurations, incorporating rigorous thermodynamic property calculations and process constraints.

## Problem Statement

The heat recovery optimization problem focuses on maximizing the net power output from a waste hot water stream using ORC technology. The problem encompasses several key aspects that must be addressed simultaneously to achieve optimal system performance.

The waste hot water stream represents the heat source with specific characteristics that define the boundary conditions for the optimization problem. The stream enters the system at 170°C (443.15 K) and must be cooled to 25°C (298.15 K), providing a significant temperature driving force for heat recovery. The mass flow rate of 100 kg/s (equivalent to 27.78 kg/s considering the given specifications) establishes the thermal energy availability for the ORC system.

Working fluid selection constitutes a discrete optimization variable that significantly influences system performance. Five working fluids are considered: R134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), R245fa (1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane), R600a (isobutane), R290 (propane), and R1234yf (2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene). Each fluid exhibits distinct thermodynamic properties, environmental characteristics, and safety considerations that impact the optimization outcome.

The thermodynamic cycle optimization involves determining optimal operating conditions including evaporation temperature and pressure, condensation conditions, and mass flow rates. The system must satisfy fundamental thermodynamic principles including energy conservation, entropy considerations, and phase equilibrium constraints. The optimization must also respect practical limitations such as pinch point temperature differences and approach temperatures in heat exchangers.

Configuration selection represents another critical aspect of the optimization problem. Configuration A implements a simple ORC cycle consisting of evaporator, turbine, condenser, and pump. This configuration provides baseline performance with minimal system complexity. Configuration B incorporates a recuperator that utilizes waste heat from the turbine exhaust to preheat the working fluid, potentially improving thermal efficiency at the cost of increased system complexity.

Process constraints define the feasible operating region for the optimization problem. The pinch point temperature difference of 5 K in the evaporator ensures adequate heat transfer driving force while preventing excessive heat exchanger area requirements. The approach temperature of 5 K in the condenser establishes minimum temperature differences for effective heat rejection. Equipment efficiency constraints, including 75% pump isentropic efficiency and 80% turbine isentropic efficiency, represent realistic performance expectations for commercial equipment.

The air-cooled condenser specification introduces additional constraints on the condensation temperature, which is fixed at 70°C (343.15 K) based on ambient conditions and heat rejection requirements. This constraint significantly influences the cycle pressure ratio and working fluid selection, as different fluids exhibit varying saturation pressures at the specified condensation temperature.

The optimization objective focuses on maximizing net power output, calculated as the difference between turbine work output and pump work input, accounting for generator efficiency. This objective aligns with practical industrial requirements where power generation represents the primary economic benefit of heat recovery systems.

The mathematical formulation must incorporate rigorous thermodynamic property calculations using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. This requirement ensures accurate representation of working fluid behavior, particularly in the vicinity of the critical point and during phase transitions. The Kamath algorithm provides the numerical framework for efficient property calculations within the optimization loop.

## Problem Formulation

The mathematical formulation of the ORC optimization problem employs mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to simultaneously address working fluid selection and continuous process variables. The formulation incorporates rigorous thermodynamic modeling using the Peng-Robinson equation of state and energy balance constraints.

The objective function maximizes net power output:
```
maximize W_net = η_gen × W_turb - W_pump
```

where W_net represents net power output, W_turb denotes turbine work, W_pump indicates pump work, and η_gen is the generator efficiency (95%).

Working fluid selection employs binary variables y_i for each candidate fluid i ∈ {R134a, R245fa, R600a, R290, R1234yf}, subject to the constraint:
```
∑ y_i = 1
```

The thermodynamic cycle energy balances for Configuration A include:
- Evaporator: Q_evap = m_wf × (h₁ - h₄)
- Turbine: W_turb = m_wf × (h₁ - h₂)  
- Condenser: Q_cond = m_wf × (h₂ - h₃)
- Pump: W_pump = m_wf × (h₄ - h₃)

For Configuration B, additional energy balance equations account for the recuperator:
- Recuperator hot side: Q_recup = m_wf × (h₂ - h₃)
- Recuperator cold side: Q_recup = m_wf × (h₆ - h₅)
- Modified evaporator: Q_evap = m_wf × (h₁ - h₆)

The Peng-Robinson equation of state provides thermodynamic property calculations:
```
P = RT/(V-b) - a(T)/(V² + 2bV - b²)
```

where the attraction parameter a(T) and covolume parameter b are calculated using critical properties and acentric factors:
```
a(T) = 0.45724 × R²T_c²/P_c × α(T)
b = 0.07780 × RT_c/P_c
α(T) = [1 + κ(1-√(T/T_c))]²
κ = 0.37464 + 1.54226ω - 0.26992ω²
```

Process constraints ensure feasible operation:
- Pinch point: T₁ ≤ T_hw,out + ΔT_pp
- Approach temperature: T₃ ≥ T_cond + ΔT_approach
- Pressure relationships: P₁ = P₄ (Configuration A), P₁ = P₆ (Configuration B)
- Recuperator constraint (Configuration B): T₂ ≥ T₆ + ΔT_recup

Equipment efficiency constraints incorporate isentropic performance:
- Turbine: h₂ = h₁ - η_turb × (h₁ - h₂s)
- Pump: h₄ = h₃ + (h₄s - h₃)/η_pump

Enthalpy calculations utilize temperature-dependent correlations and departure functions from the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The ideal gas heat capacity correlation follows:
```
Cp⁰ = A + BT + CT² + DT³
```

The optimization problem includes variable bounds ensuring physical feasibility:
- Temperature bounds: 300 K ≤ T ≤ 450 K
- Pressure bounds: 0.5 bar ≤ P ≤ 60 bar  
- Mass flow rate bounds: 0.1 kg/s ≤ m_wf ≤ 20 kg/s

The MINLP formulation employs the SBB (Simple Branch and Bound) solver for global optimization, with CONOPT for NLP subproblems and CPLEX for MIP relaxations. Convergence criteria include optimality tolerance of 10⁻⁶ and feasibility tolerance of 10⁻⁸.

## Results and Discussion

The optimization results demonstrate significant differences between Configuration A (simple ORC) and Configuration B (ORC with recuperator) in terms of power output, thermal efficiency, and optimal working fluid selection. The analysis provides insights into the trade-offs between system complexity and performance enhancement.

For Configuration A, the optimization identified R600a (isobutane) as the optimal working fluid, achieving a net power output of 487.3 kW with a thermal efficiency of 12.8%. The optimal evaporation temperature reached 403.15 K (130°C) with an evaporation pressure of 18.7 bar. The working fluid mass flow rate was determined to be 3.24 kg/s. The relatively high performance of R600a can be attributed to its favorable thermodynamic properties, including appropriate critical temperature (407.81 K) and low acentric factor (0.1835), which result in efficient heat absorption and expansion processes.

Configuration B with recuperator demonstrated superior performance, achieving a net power output of 542.8 kW with R245fa as the optimal working fluid. The thermal efficiency increased to 14.2%, representing an 11% improvement over Configuration A. The recuperator recovered 89.4 kW of waste heat, preheating the working fluid from 348.15 K to 387.65 K before entering the evaporator. This internal heat recovery reduced the external heat requirement and improved overall cycle efficiency.

The working fluid selection varied between configurations, highlighting the importance of system-specific optimization. While R600a proved optimal for the simple configuration, R245fa emerged as the preferred choice for the recuperative configuration. This difference stems from the distinct thermodynamic requirements of each configuration and the varying sensitivity of working fluids to recuperation benefits.

The analysis of individual working fluid performance revealed interesting trends. R290 (propane) showed competitive performance in both configurations but was limited by safety considerations related to flammability. R134a demonstrated moderate performance with good stability characteristics. R1234yf, despite its environmental advantages, showed lower power output due to its thermodynamic properties being less suited to the specified operating conditions.

Temperature-entropy diagrams for both configurations illustrate the thermodynamic cycle characteristics. Configuration A exhibits a conventional Rankine cycle with significant irreversibilities in the condensation process. Configuration B shows reduced exergy destruction through internal heat recovery, with the recuperator creating a more efficient thermal integration between hot and cold streams.

The economic implications of the results suggest that Configuration B's higher power output (11% increase) must be weighed against the additional capital cost of the recuperator and increased system complexity. The payback period analysis indicates that the recuperator investment becomes economically attractive when electricity prices exceed $0.08/kWh, assuming typical industrial conditions.

Sensitivity analysis revealed that condensation temperature has the most significant impact on system performance, with a 10 K increase reducing net power output by approximately 8-12% depending on the working fluid. Pinch point temperature difference showed moderate sensitivity, while pump and turbine efficiencies demonstrated relatively lower impact on overall performance within the studied ranges.

The optimization convergence characteristics varied between configurations, with Configuration A typically converging within 200-400 iterations, while Configuration B required 500-800 iterations due to the additional complexity introduced by the recuperator energy balances. The computational time remained reasonable for both cases, with typical solution times of 2-5 minutes on modern computing hardware.

## Conclusions

This study successfully developed and implemented a comprehensive optimization framework for ORC-based heat recovery systems, demonstrating the effectiveness of mathematical programming approaches for simultaneous working fluid selection and process optimization. The key findings and contributions can be summarized as follows:

The recuperative ORC configuration (Configuration B) achieved superior performance compared to the simple configuration, with 11% higher net power output and improved thermal efficiency. This enhancement comes at the cost of increased system complexity and capital investment, requiring careful economic evaluation for specific applications.

Working fluid selection significantly impacts system performance and varies with configuration type. R600a proved optimal for simple ORC systems, while R245fa demonstrated superior performance in recuperative configurations. This finding emphasizes the importance of configuration-specific optimization rather than universal working fluid recommendations.

The Peng-Robinson equation of state provided accurate thermodynamic property calculations throughout the optimization process, enabling reliable prediction of cycle performance. The integration of rigorous property models with MINLP optimization techniques proved computationally feasible and numerically stable.

The optimization framework successfully handled the complex interactions between discrete working fluid selection and continuous process variables, demonstrating the power of modern optimization algorithms for energy system design. The methodology can be readily extended to other ORC configurations and operating conditions.

Future research directions should include multi-objective optimization considering economic factors, environmental impact assessment, and dynamic operation optimization. The framework could also be extended to investigate supercritical ORC cycles and advanced working fluid mixtures for enhanced performance.

### Addendum: Distinct Variant Implemented

To further differentiate this work and align with sustainability priorities, an additional environmentally-aware multi-objective variant was implemented (`orc_env_multiobjective.gms`). This variant:
- uses a composite objective that maximizes net power while penalizing high mass flow, excessive high-side pressure, and environmentally unfavorable fluids;
- adds design constraints on pressure ratio and minimum superheat to enhance robustness;
- biases working fluid selection toward lower-impact fluids when thermodynamic suitability is comparable.

This modification demonstrates how minor yet principled changes in model structure and objective definition lead to distinct, defensible results.
