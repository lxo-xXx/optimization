## ⚙️ **SOLVER SETTINGS OPTIMIZATION**

### **For Competition Performance:**
```gms
* Primary solver settings
OPTION MINLP = BARON;
OPTION RESLIM = 600;        // 10 minutes max
OPTION OPTCR = 0.01;        // 1% optimality gap
OPTION ITERLIM = 50000;     // Iteration limit

* Backup solver if BARON fails
OPTION MINLP = ANTIGONE;
OPTION MINLP = ALPHAECP;
```

### **Quick Testing Settings:**
```gms
OPTION RESLIM = 120;        // 2 minutes for quick tests
OPTION OPTCR = 0.05;        // 5% gap for speed
```

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **If Model is Infeasible:**
1. Check critical pressure constraint (reduce from 0.8 to 0.7)
2. Adjust temperature bounds (increase ranges)
3. Relax pinch point constraint (increase from 5K to 8K)
4. Use backup model

### **If Solver Fails:**
1. Try different MINLP solver
2. Reduce time limit and accept suboptimal solution
3. Use improved teammate model (sequential approach)

### **If Results Look Wrong:**
1. Check energy balance closure
2. Verify state point temperatures are physical
3. Confirm selected fluid makes sense
4. Cross-validate with backup model
