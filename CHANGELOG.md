## ðŸ“‹ Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Highlights

This major release introduces significant enhancements to the Grey Wolf Optimizer for multi-objective optimization, addressing key areas of improvement:

1. **Enhanced Population Diversity**: Smart leader selection and sigma-sharing
2. **Strengthened Exploration/Exploitation**: Differential mutation and adaptive parameters
3. **Improved Archive Diversity**: Clustering-based pruning and boundary protection
4. **Reduced Hypervolume Fluctuation**: Dynamic reference point and better convergence

### Breaking Changes

- **API Changes**: New parameters added to GWO constructor (backward compatible)
- **Archive Interface**: Enhanced methods added (backward compatible)
- **Performance**: Improved performance may affect reproducibility of exact results

### Migration Guide

For users upgrading from version 0.x:

```python
# Old version
gwo = GWO(func, dim, bounds, pop_size, max_iter, archive_size, power_a)

# New version (backward compatible)
gwo = GWO(func, dim, bounds, pop_size, max_iter, archive_size, power_a)

# New version (with enhancements)
gwo = GWO(
    func, dim, bounds, pop_size, max_iter, archive_size, power_a,
    use_differential_mutation=True,
    use_dynamic_ref=True,
    use_smart_leader_selection=True,
    F=0.5, CR=0.9
)
```

### Dependencies
