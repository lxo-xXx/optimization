### 3. Algorithm Robustness
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct multiple runs (typically 30) for statistical significance
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Analyze sensitivity to key parameters
- **Benchmark Expansion**: Test on additional UF and DTLZ benchmark problems

## Limitations of Current Analysis

1. **Access to Original Results**: Without access to the complete 2016 paper, direct numerical comparison is limited
2. **Single Run Analysis**: Statistical significance requires multiple independent runs
3. **Limited Benchmark Set**: Analysis focused on UF1 and UF7; broader evaluation recommended
4. **Parameter Tuning**: Limited parameter optimization conducted
