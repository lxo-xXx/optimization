% Experiments and Protocols
\section{Experimental Protocols}
\label{sec:experiments}
We outline reproducible benchmarks rather than specific task-dependent results, enabling fair comparisons across algorithms and problem classes.

\subsection{Problem suites}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Logistic regression with $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ regularization (convex)
  \item LASSO and elastic net (composite)
  \item Nonnegative matrix factorization (nonconvex)
  \item Quadratic programs and cone programs (constrained)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Metrics}
Time-to-\emph{target} suboptimality, gradient norm, feasibility and dual residuals (for constrained), iterations, and wall-clock time.

\subsection{Protocols}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Fixed random seeds and standardized data splits
  \item Line-search settings and stopping criteria recorded
  \item Hyperparameter grids and selection rules pre-registered
  \item Hardware configuration reported
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results placeholder}
Insert figures and tables here using \texttt{graphicx} and \texttt{booktabs}. For instance, a convergence plot comparing GD, L-BFGS, and FISTA on LASSO, and a table summarizing time-to-target across datasets.
