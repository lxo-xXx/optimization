\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We surveyed advanced numerical optimization methods spanning first- and second-order techniques, proximal algorithms, interior-point and augmented Lagrangian methods, and stochastic and distributed approaches. We highlighted convergence strategies, implementation practices, and experimental protocols. Future work includes automated algorithm selection driven by problem structure, tighter theory for nonconvex regimes, and improved communication-efficient distributed optimization.
